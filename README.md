I'm a software engineer building quality software and trying to make this world a little bit better.
I believe in giving back to the community. It's the best way to keep myself engaged that also leads to making an impact on the community.
I enjoy working with the Javascript stack. I love its community, technologies, and the problems it solves.

I write articles on my personal blog [sthabipin.com.np](https://www.sthabipin.com.np)

If you are curious to know ðŸ¤”, Iâ€™m currently working ðŸ”­ on a SAAS project.
